# JavaScript-Project-6
 Express Portfolio Page

CSS changes:

Changed main area background-color to be a really light blue.  

Added a hover animation/transition for the links to the projects.

Along with the animation, I added a box-shadow that seemed "logical" Makes the images look like their being lifted off a wall.
